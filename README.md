AndroidLogoCSS
==============

This is the implementation of animated android logo in CSS. Animation is added to head as well as both hands upon mouse hover. If you would like to see some more interactive animated actions, let me know. Will add them as time permits.

This logo is capable of performing animation so make sure to hover mouse over logo to view some really cool effects just by using CSS3 and HTML.

In the meantime, demo of Android logo simulation in CSS and HTML can be viewed at,
